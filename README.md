## Time-domain Timbre Transformation

The aim is to transfer timbre from one musical source to another musical source, but entirely in the time domain.

Frequency domain methods typically struggle with phase reconstruction issues which time-domain approaches seek to avoid.

The most popular dataset for this is the [NSynth dataset by Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth), though a newer dataset such as [Amp-Space](https://dafx2020.mdw.ac.at/proceedings/papers/DAFx20in21_paper_47.pdf) may be used once it is released.
